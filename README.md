# article-api
RESTful api with express for articles.

Challenge project from "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu/The App Brewery.

To setup the database, download and setup MongoDB Community (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) locally and create a database called wikiDB.

Initialize NPM in the app directory, NPM install express, body-parser, ejs, and mongoose, and use 'node app.js' to run locally on localhost:3000/articles.


Here is an example of POST/DELETE using Postman for the '/articles' route.
